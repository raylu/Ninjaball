Ninjaball

with help from David Lu

This is meant to run on Linux. If you can make it run (or even build)
elsewhere, cool. Can you tell me how?

You need to have these libraries on Debian/Ubuntu:

libsdl
libsdl-ttf
libsdl-mixer
libsdl-image
libsdl-gfx

And these on Fedora:

SDL-devel
SDL_ttf-devel
SDL_mixer-devel
SDL_image-devel
SDL_gfx-devel

To build, cd into src/ and run make.

I don't know that this list is exhaustive, nor that it's minimal. These
are the relevant-looking ones I have installed on the machine I develop
on.

Once make runs successfully, launch the game with ./ninjaball.
