Ninjaball
by ZAK Magnus
with help from David Lu

This is meant to run on Linux. If you can make it run (or even build)
elsewhere, cool. Can you tell me how?

To build, cd into src/ and run make. You need to have these libraries:

libsdl
libsdl-ttf
libsdl-mixer
libsdl-image
libsdl-gfx

I don't know that this list is exhaustive, nor that it's minimal. These
are the relevant-looking ones I have installed on the machine I develop
on.

Once make runs successfully, launch the game with ./ninjaball.
