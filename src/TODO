refactor:
-figure out how to use _t naming correctly
-rename Moveable holy shit
-figure out refs vs. pointers, for ex. physics_t
-add more overloads to vectors (left side *?)
-use this-> consistently

build:
-make makefile reflect actual dependencies
-add more warnings/errors!

physics:
-rotations?? x_x

bugs:
-hook attaches in weird ways sometimes
-bouncing off near-horizontal slopes when the slope's object is on a horizontal immobile doesn't work
-multi-onness on non-vertical/horizontal is possible because of floating point imprecision

possible features:
-turning the string into a (solid) rope (chain of constraints)
-more physics: hinges (just a constraint), motor (rotating hinges), springs (yet another constraint)

design:
*ALL THE THINGS



level launching (turn main loop into a function)
