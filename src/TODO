refactor:
-figure out how to use _t naming correctly
-rename Moveable holy shit
-figure out refs vs. pointers, for ex. physics_t
-add more overloads to vectors (left side *?)
-use this-> consistently

build:
-make makefile reflect actual dependencies
-add more warnings/errors!

physics:
-rotations?? x_x

bugs:
-hook can fly through objects because it advances too quickly
-the hook can "retroactively" attach to things in the middle of the rope
-bouncing off near-horizontal slopes when the slope's object is on a horizontal immobile doesn't work
