refactor:
-figure out how to use _t naming correctly
-rename Moveable holy shit
-figure out refs vs. pointers, for ex. physics_t
-add more overloads to vectors (left side *?)
-use this-> consistently

build:
-make makefile reflect actual dependencies
-add more warnings/errors!

physics:
-more solids? surfaces?

bugs:
-sometimes things can get "inside" each other via weird collisions
-hook can fly through objects because it advances too quickly
